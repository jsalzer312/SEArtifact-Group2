# How to contribute

## The basics
* Submit a ticket for your issue, if one does not already exist.
* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repo.
* Do some work, and file a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

## Git guidelines
* Branches should be based on *develop*
* To create a branch: `git checkout develop && git pull && git checkout -b issue-abc-comment`
* Pull requests must be rebased onto the latest from *develop* before they will be merged.
* Make your commits logical units. Commits messages should look like: `git commit -m "Issue abc. Comment goes here"`
