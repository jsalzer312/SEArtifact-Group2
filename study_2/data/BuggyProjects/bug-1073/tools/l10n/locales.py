# Sorted list of locales that ship in release builds of Focus/Klar.
#
# Other builds might include more locales.
#
# Note that there are differences in the locale codes used by Pontoon
# and by Android (e.g. Hebrew: he (Pontoon) vs. iw (Android)).
# This list uses the Android notation. A valid entry can be a
# language code (de) or a language plus country (de-DE). Do not use
# the name of the Androidresource folder (de-rDE) here.
#
# Releases should contain all locales that are at 100% or have been
# shipping in previous releases. Ping :delphine in case you want
# to add or remove locales from releases.
