Problem

If the "sync" icon isn't clicked after manually entering coordinates, the fishing spot's coordinates aren't updated accordingly.

Reproduction steps

Create a new, or edit an existing location
Add fishing spot
Manually enter coordinates (do not click the sync button)
Save
In the edit location screen the coordinates are not correct
Solution

The add fishing spot screen should get and validate its coordinates from the TextView widgets, not the middle of the map. If the coordinates are invalid, the user should see a dialog (this may already be implemented).
