# Summary
This is the replication package for the ISSTA'24 paper titled "Toward the Automated Localization of Buggy Mobile App UIs from Bug Descriptions".
Authors: Antu Saha, Yang Song, Junayed Mahmud, Ying Zhou, Kevin Moran, and Oscar Chaparro.

In the paper, we conducted two studies:
1. Buggy UI Localization (study_1): We proposed localizing buggy UIs (screen and component) for a given bug descriptions (observed behaviors) of bug reports. We evaluated four models (i.e., LUCENE, SBERT, CLIP, and BLIP) to accomplish the buggy UI localization tasks (i.e., screen localization and component localization). 
2. Buggy Code Localization (study_2): We proposed automating an exising buggy code localization which uses GUI screen information by utilizing the localized buggy UIs from the buggy UI localization. We evaluated the buggy code localization performance on two models (i.e., LUCENE and BugLocator).

In this replication package, we refer to the Buggy UI Localization as ```study_1``` and the Buggy Code Localization as ```study_2```.

# Getting Started
This section contains the steps to set up the environment and reproduce the results of Buggy UI Localization tasks (study_1) and Buggy Code Localization experiments (study_2) of the paper. Note that study_1, i.e., Buggy UI Localization tasks (screen and component localization) are the main focus of the paper. All the experiments of study_1 can be replicated in 1 hour. However, replicating the results of study_2, i.e., Buggy Code Localization will take a while depending on the experiment. We already provided the results of all the experiments of both studies. Rerunning the experiments will overwrite the results.

    * Installs Apache Maven (3.6.3)
    * Adds JDK and Maven to your file path
    * Installs pip
    * Installs Python modules required for this artifact

Note: If you already have a previous Python version installed, run ```python3 --version``` to see if you have the correct version of ```Python 3.10.12```. If not, change your Python version to 3.10.12

## Reproducing the Results of Buggy UI Localization (study_1)

Note: study_1_fix_issues.sh only works for Linux or MacOS users
1. Run ```study_1_fix_issues.sh``` to fix all the issues for the project with this command: ```sh environment.sh```
* ```study_1_fix_issues.sh``` resolves:
  * Adds missing dependencies to pom.xml (commons-io, commons-cli, org.slf4j, Stanford CoreNLP)
  * Downloads all required dependencies
  * Fixes wrong file paths mentioned in the repository

2. Run ```run_cmnd.sh``` for reproducing the results with this command: ```sh run_cmnd.sh```. If you use windows, please create a similar script. This script will run all the experiments of Study 1. The experiments can be run within one hour using this script. For running each experiment separately, please comment out the commands of other experiments.
3. The results will be stored in the ```results``` directory where ```SL``` folder will contain screen localization results and ```CL``` will contain component localization results. The results are already provided (as CSV files). Rerunning the experiments will overwrite the results.
4. The results summary will be saved in ```study_1/results/results_summary.xlsx``` file. The file is already provided. Rerunning the script will overwrite the results summary.
5. Performance comparing different models using different metrics (h@k, MAP, MRR) are stored in ```study_1/results/graphs```.
